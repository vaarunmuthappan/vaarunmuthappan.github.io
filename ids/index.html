                <div class="section-content">
                    <p><strong>Inference</strong> means making conclusions from data. We need probability because formal
                        logic describes things as always or never true which is rarely true in real-life situations.
                        Natural
                        language is too subjective to describe the uncertainty in life, so we use math to describe
                        uncertainty through probability.</p>

                    <p>An <strong>experiment</strong> is something repeatable.
                        The <strong>probability
                            space</strong> consists of the sample space, event space, and probability measure.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sample Space</strong> (&#937;) is the set of all possible outcomes from one random
                            experiment.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <strong>event space</strong> is the
                            set
                            of all events possible, while an <strong>event</strong> is a set of outcomes.</li>
                        <li>A
                            <strong>probability
                                measure</strong> maps the event space to a number from 0 to 1.
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>A <strong>random variable</strong> is a function that maps the sample space to real numbers.
                        <strong>Axioms</strong> are things we assume to be true.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Three Axioms of Probability:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Axiom 1:</strong> Probabilities are positive real numbers, greater than or equal
                                to 0.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Axiom 2:</strong> The probability that an outcome is in the sample space (Omega)
                                equals
                                1.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Axiom 3:</strong> For disjoint subsets, the probability of their union is the sum
                                of
                                their
                                individual probabilities.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>Probability Rules</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Addition rule:</strong> The probability of a union b is p(a) + p(b) - p(a and b).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Multiplication rule:</strong> If events are independent, it's p(a) * p(b). If not
                                independent, it's p(a) * p(b|a).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Conditional probability:</strong> p(b | a) is the probability of b given a, calculated as
                        p(b
                        intersection a) / p(a). The sample space shrinks to a, so of all probability of a, we need the
                        part
                        where b also happens.</p>

                    <p><strong>Normal distribution</strong> occurs if 1) there are lots of events and 2) each event is
                        independent
                        of each other.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Moments</strong> characterize the shape of a distribution. Moments come from moment
                        generating functions that converge (as some do
                        not).
                    </p>
                    <p>The moment generating function (MGF) of a random variable \(X\) is defined as:</p>
                    <p>
                        \[M_X(t) = E[e^{tX}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{tx} f_X(x) dx\]
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Example of a distribution that does not converge:</strong> The Cauchy distribution. It
                        has undefined
                        expected value and variance, with higher raw moments also undefined. It is characterized by fat
                        tails. This becomes relevant when dealing with black swan
                        events.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>First (raw) moment:</strong> E[x], or the "balancing point". These are raw
                                because
                                they're
                                centered on the origin.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Second (centralized) moment:</strong> Variance. These are centralised as they are
                                calculated by subtracting the
                                mean.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Third (centralized) moment:</strong> Cubed deviation. If equal, it's symmetric;
                                otherwise,
                                it's asymmetric.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Fourth moment (centralized):</strong> Kurtosis, which indicates heavy tails
                                compared to a
                                normal distribution. In a normal distribution, it drops off extremely and exponentially
                                with
                                increasing n.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>There are 5+ moments, but these are the most common. For example, the Edgeworth series has hyper
                        skew
                        moment which is the 5th moment.</p>

                <h2 class="section-header">Hypothesis Testing</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p><strong>Normal distribution:</strong> Symmetric and fully described by the first two moments. It
                        results
                        from the combination of 1) lots of 2) independent events.</p>

                    <h3>Hypothesis Testing:</h3>

                    <p><strong>Weak Law of Large Numbers:</strong> For random sampling from independent and identically
                        distributed (IID) variables with finite mean and variance (excluding black swan events like
                        Cauchy distribution), the probability of the difference between the sample mean deviation and
                        population mean being larger than a small epsilon approaches zero. This applies only to
                        probability and individual deviations can still occur.</p>

                    <p><strong>Central Limit Theorem (CLT):</strong> With repeated resampling, the distribution of
                        sample means becomes normal as sample size increases, regardless of the underlying population,
                        provided the underlying population has finite mean and variance. This phenomenon occurs due to
                        the cancellation of
                        deviations.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The CLT applies to the distribution of sample means, not the sample itself.</li>
                        <li>It begins to take effect as soon as the sample size increases.</li>
                        <li>Hence, 30 is not a magic number for a "big" sample size, although there is value going above
                            a sample size of 30 as the standard error of the mean continues to decrease with larger
                            sample sizes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Random Sampling:</strong> Every member of the population has an equal chance of being
                        chosen. The opposite is sampling bias.</p>

                    <p><strong>Standard Error of the Mean (SEM):</strong> Calculated as the standard deviation of sample
                        means divided by the square root of the sample size. To decrease SEM, the sample size must be
                        increased by the square of the desired reduction factor.</p>

                    <p><strong>Practical Implications:</strong> In real-life scenarios, we typically have only one
                        sample, not multiple samples of size n. The CLT is relevant because it ensures that deviations
                        from the true mean decrease with the square root of the sample size, allowing us to be confident
                        that a single sample is as close as possible to the population mean.</p>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <p><strong>Common Misconception:</strong> The CLT doesn't suddenly converge at a sample size of
                            30.
                            It begins converging as soon as the sample size increases, even from 1 to 2. The notion that
                            30
                            is sufficient isn't universally true, especially for certain unusual distributions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Mean vs. Median:</strong> The mean minimizes the squared L2 distance between points,
                        while the median minimizes the L1 distance (absolute).</p>

                    <h3>Real Experiments:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create treatment and conditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Randomly</strong> assign users to different treatments (Treatments = Independent
                            variable).</li>
                        <li>Measure outcomes and analyze.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Randomization: </strong> The important aspect that allows us to establish causality.
                        Given a large number of users, randomization can control for
                        pre-existing relationships, as we can assume an equal proportion of confounds in
                        each treatment. This is also more likely with a large sample size, which is why large sample
                        size is again important.</p>

                    <p><strong>A/B Tests:</strong> These apply experimental procedures to real-life situations, allowing
                        for practical implementation of controlled experiments.</p>

                    <h3>Statistical Significance:</h3>

                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Given that the null hypothesis is true, the observation is unlikely
                        due to chance alone. This is a statement about data, not a conclusion. It means the probability
                        of the data is below a chosen level (the "alpha" level), assuming the null hypothesis is true.
                        (Also invented by <a
                            href=https://www.washington.edu/news/2016/12/21/documents-that-changed-the-world-sir-ronald-fisher-defines-statistical-significance-1925 />Fischer</a>.)
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> It represents p(data | null hypothesis), not p(hypothesis |
                        data). However, it can be inverted using Bayes' theorem and prior probabilities.</p>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <p><strong>Caution:</strong> There's always a chance that sampling error alone could produce
                            unlikely data. Hypothesis testing does not <strong>prove</strong> anything.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Null Hypothesis Significance Testing:</h3>

                    <p>Method based on falsification to test hypothesis. This method assumes the opposite is true (null
                        hypothesis), collects data, and then shows
                        that either 1) the result is so unlikely that the null hypothesis is dropped, supporting the
                        alternative hypothesis. 2) or the result is plausible due to the null hypothesis and nothing is
                        done.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>p-value</strong> is the probability of observing the data assuming the null
                        hypothesis is true. For countable data, binomial distribution or combinatorics can be used to
                        find this probability.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> The commonly used significance level of 0.05 (1 in 20 chance)
                        originated from Fisher, who found it convenient in an era without calculators. Thus, the choice
                        of alpha (significance level) is somewhat arbitrary.</p>
                    <div class="card">
                        <p>End result is always a p-value for significance tests.</p>

                <h2 class="section-header">Parametric Significance Tests</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Parametric significance tests is a type of significance test, so you drop the null hypothesis if
                        the probability of the data is too large
                        to be plausibly consistent with chance. These tests reduce the data to a distribution with a
                        parameter,
                        usually the mean.</p>

                    <h3>Methodology:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Establish null hypothesis</li>
                        <li>Calculate test statistic</li>
                        <li>Determine likelihood of statistic under null hypothesis (p-value)</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>All tests measure how far the data is from the population mean in units of Standard Error of the
                        Mean (SEM).</p>

                    <p><strong>Misconception:</strong> Normalization doesn't necessarily mean the data becomes normally
                        distributed. It's primarily used to compare variables different units on the same space.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Errors:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Type 1 Error (False Positive):</strong> Concluding significance when there isn't any in
                        reality. This could be due to sampling error.</p>

                    <p><strong>Type 2 Error (False Negative):</strong> Failing to detect significance when it exists.
                        This can occur if the sampling error is too large, and can be mitigated by increasing sample
                        size.</p>

                    <h3>Z-test:</h3>
                    <p>Z = (sample mean - population mean) / SEM</p>
                    <p>SEM = population sd / ân</p>

                    <p>The Z-score is converted to a probability using the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, sd =
                        1). However, this test has limitations: it usually requires knowledge of population mean and SD,
                        and relies on the Central Limit Theorem.</p>

                    <h3>Degrees of Freedom (DOF):</h3>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <p><strong>Misconception:</strong> DOF is not always n-1.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Why is it called this? Comes from DOF in mechanics- how many ways can an object move.</p>
                    <p>DOF represents the number of independent pieces of information in the dataset. It's calculated as
                        n - k, where k is the number of calculations performed.</p>
                    <p>Higher DOF, more evidence, more stable estimate is. Only increased if more independent samples
                        added, ie measurements not calculations. </p>
                    <p><strong>Marginals:</strong> Are sums of rows / columns. IE total calculation. So if you have 1
                        marginal, one value is completely determined. </p>
                    <p>DOF: (r-1)*(c-1) for table (r includes extra row for sum / marginals).</p>

                    <h3>(Student) T-test:</h3>
                    <p>Used for small sample sizes and unknown population parameters. As DOF increases, the
                        t-distribution approaches the z-distribution.</p>

                    <p>T statistic = (sample mean 1 - sample mean 2) / SEMpooled</p>

                    <p>Assumptions: mean is meaningful, data is normally distributed, homogeneity of variance.</p>

                    <p>Two versions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>T-test for 2 independent groups (DOF = n1 + n2 - 2)</li>
                        <li>T-test for 1 correlated group (DOF = N - 1)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Welch's t-test:</h3>
                    <p>Preferred when homogeneity of variance can't be assumed. Like Student's t-test, but it doesn't
                        pool
                        variance and models them seperately, leading to possible fractional DOF.</p>

                    <h3>ANOVA:</h3>
                    <p>Extends t-test logic to more groups. Equivalent to multiple regression.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="collapsible-section" id="non-parametric-tests">
                <h2 class="section-header">Non-parametric Significance Tests</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Non-parametric tests are needed when it does not make sense to reduce data to sample means, such
                        as with
                        categorical data or ratings.</p>
                    <h3>Types of Data:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Categorical:</strong> Sets with common attributes, only having nominality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ratings:</strong> Discrete but not categorical. They have nominality and ordinality,
                            but not cardinality.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Properties of Numbers:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nominality</li>
                        <li>Cardinality</li>
                        <li>Ordinality</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Non-parametric tests typically require higher sample sizes / power but have fewer assumptions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Chi-squared Test:</h3>
                    <p>Used for categorical counts or frequencies. It compares observed data patterns with expected
                        frequency counts under the null hypothesis.</p>
                    <p>Test statistic: sum of ((differences squared) / expected Count)</p>
                    <p>Degrees of freedom (DOF) = number of categories - 1</p>
                    <p>Both location and spread increases with increasing DF.</p>

                    <h3>Mann-Whitney U Test:</h3>
                    <p>Also known as Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test or ranksum test. It tests whether two samples come from
                        populations with the same median.</p>
                    <p>Procedure: Rank all data from smallest to largest; sum of ranks for both datasets should be
                        similar if from populations with same median.</p>
                    <p>Note: Still possible to have different distributions that happen to have the same median.</p>

                    <h3>Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test:</h3>
                    <p>Compares underlying distributions via the empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).</p>
                    <p>Procedure: Finds maximum distance between two distributions and compares to the null hypothesis
                        that distributions are the same.</p>

                    <h3>Kruskal-Wallis Test:</h3>
                    <p>Non-parametric version of ANOVA for 3+ groups.</p>

                    <h3>Permutation Test Approach:</h3>
                    <p>For unusual cases, you can create your own test using this approach:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Develop a statistic based on domain knowledge</li>
                        <li>Sample without replacement</li>
                        <li>Calculate the statistic for all groups</li>
                        <li>Determine the p-value using statistic of original group</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Note: Results should be robust to details of the test statistic.</p>

                <h2 class="section-header">Problems with p-values</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Decisions based solely on statistical significance can be misleading. P-values merely indicate
                        statistical significance, which just says
                        that assuming null hypothesis (and a proven distribution of data under null hypothesis), data is
                        unlikely.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Contextualizing p-values:</h3>
                    <p>P-values need to be considered alongside:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Effect Size</li>
                        <li>Statistical Power</li>
                        <li>Confidence</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Replicability Crisis:</strong> Many results fail to replicate, primarily due to lack of
                        statistical power. Root cause is lack of power, proximal causes are p-hacking and the
                        incentive to publish statistically significant results.</p>

                    <h3>P-hacking:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Flexible stopping:</strong> Adding observations until reaching the significance
                            threshold, leading to alpha inflation. P-values are typically just below alpha level as we
                            stop as soon as significan is reached, as adding more datapoints might push it above
                            statistically significant level.</li>
                        <li><strong>HARKing (Hypothesis After Results are Known):</strong> Developing hypotheses based
                            on which variables show significance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Removal of outliers:</strong> (Removing outliers). Should only be done if the
                            outlier is known to be
                            erroneous.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Effect Size:</h3>
                    <p>Measures the practical significance of / difference. IE The magnitude of the real difference in
                        populations. For example, Cohen's d = (pop 1 mean - pop 2
                        mean
                        ) / sd of population. (Implied sample size of 1)</p>
                    <p>Typical effect sizes in psychology are around 0.2 to 0.25.</p>

                    <p>Effect size is independent of sample size, but the ability to detect it relates to sample size
                        through statistical power.</p>

                <h2 class="section-header">Power and Confidence</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <h3>Statistical Power</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The probability of detecting an effect of a given size if the effect
                        exists. Mathematically, it's expressed as 1 - Î², where Î² is the probability of making a Type II
                        error.</p>
                    <p>Typically, a power of at least 0.8 (Î² = 0.2) is desired. Power is implicitly set by your sample
                        size
                        and effect size.</p>
                    <p>Tells you what sample size is large enough if you know what effect size is likely to be.</p>

                    <p><strong>Importance of Power:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Determines adequate sample size</li>
                        <li>Allows absence of evidence to become evidence of absence</li>
                        <li>Helps prevent real effects from being overwhelmed by sampling error</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Factors Affecting Power</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Alpha level:</strong> Higher alpha increases power by accepting more H1</li>
                        <li><strong>Sample size:</strong> Larger samples increase power non-linearly (ân relationship)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Effect size:</strong> Larger effects increase power due to greater distance between
                            means. (easier to spot difference).</li>
                        <li><strong>Type of test:</strong> Pairwise t-test > independent t-test (removes variability as
                            everyone is own control, so better chance of finding effect.) > parametric ( if assumptions
                            of t-test met its powerful.
                            ) >
                            non-parametric (Lot of information in distance between points that parametric can use).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Power Curve:</strong> TODO: INSERT. </p>
                    <p>In psychology, real effects are typically around 0.2. The rate of
                        significant findings should be 10%-30%, but is often reported as 95% in practice[7].</p>

                    <p><strong>Legitimate way to increase power:</strong> Using a one-tailed test can increase power by
                        increasing alpha.</p>

                    <p><strong>A Priori vs. Post Hoc Power:</strong> Only a priori power analysis is considered valid.
                        Post-hoc (observed) power can be misleading due to potential discrepancies between true and
                        sample effect sizes.</p>


                    <h3>Confidence Intervals</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A range that likely contains the true population parameter.</p>

                    <p>Confidence intervals visualize sampling error. A 95% CI means that if the study were repeated,
                        95% of the time the parameter would fall within the interval, assuming only sampling error.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> CI can be calculated using z*SEM if the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
                        holds. If CLT cannot be proven, bootstrap methods are used.</p>

                    <p><strong>Absence of evidence:</strong> CI is very wide. If higher statistical power, shrink CI,
                        hence evidence of absence. </p>


                    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                    <p>A resampling with replacement technique used to estimate confidence intervals when normal
                        distribution assumptions
                        don't hold.</p>

                    <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Bootstrap can be dangerous with small samples as it may overrepresent
                        parameters. It's only effective if the entire sample is representative of the population[6].</p>

                    <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Bootstrapping provides more numbers but not more data, and does not
                        increase degrees of freedom. Works only if sample is representative of population.</p>

                        for updating prior beliefs with new information, which can be advantageous when prior beliefs
                        are well-founded.

                        evidence for one hypothesis over another, calculated as the ratio of likelihoods under one
                        hypothesis over another.</p>
                    <p>Factor of 100 means p(d | h1) is 100x more than p(d | h0)
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bayesian Power Analysis</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>Positive Predictive Value (PPV)</strong> represents the post-study probability that a
                        significant result is true (p(effect true | significant) = p(True) * p(sig | true) / p(sig)
                        ):</p>

                    <div>
                        \[= \frac{\frac{\text{true}}{\text{total}} \cdot \text{power}}{\text{power} \cdot
                        \left(\frac{\text{true}}{\text{total}}\right) + \alpha \cdot
                        \left(\frac{\text{false}}{\text{total}}\right)}\]
                    </div>
                    <p>This formula highlights that the false positive rate depends on power, prior probability of a
                        true effect, and is not (necessarily) equal to the false positive rate.</p>
                    <p>Need higher power (ability to detect affect) to get higher posterior PPV. IE higher ability to
                        detect effect if present means can get higher post study probability that a significant result
                        is true. So if studying far fetched stuff make sure you have enough power. Pre-study odds can be
                        from literature. </p>

                    <h3>Bayesian Credible Intervals</h3>
                    <p>In Bayesian statistics, parameters are treated as random variables with distributions
                        corresponding to our prior beliefs. As sample
                        size increases, the likelihood dominates the prior, converging to frequentist results with
                        infinite data.</p>
                    <p>Hence if lots of data (high power), just use frequentist approach. If not much data but strong
                        prior, use bayesian approach.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Regression and Classification</li>
                        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Dimension Reduction and Clustering</li>
                        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
                    <p><strong>Regression</strong> models correlations, not causation. It minimizes the summed squared
                        distance (L2 norm) between predictions and actual values.</p>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <p>Don't interpret regression causally, could be confounders that contribute to both. Regression
                            is purely correlation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Why is it called regression? Rule of 3 was used before, and Galton realised outcomes âregressâ to
                        mean, hence called regression. </p>

                    <p><strong>Beta coefficient:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scaling factor making independent variable closest to dependent variable.</li>
                        <li>Interpreted as the change in standard deviations of DV for one standard deviation change in
                            IV</li>
                        <li>Calculated as $$ \beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty $$</li>
                        <li>Equivalent to projecting data points onto subspace A (either, line plane etc. representing
                            regression model), and finding A that minimises distance to all points. Hence can find beta
                            in terms of linear algebra.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Residual:</strong></string>distance from prediction and actual value. (Point: Not
                        perpendicular distance but vertical to prediction line)
                    </p>

                    <h3>Multiple Regression</h3>
                    <p>Allows comparison of multiple variables by accounting for confounds. It can help control for
                        variables when experiments are not possible, but data is available on known confounds.</p>

                    <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²):</strong> Proportion of variance explained by the model
                    </p>
                    <p>$$ R^2 = \frac{\text{Explained Variance}}{\text{Total Variance}} $$</p>

                    <p><strong>R:</strong> Correlation between predicted and actual values.</p>

                    <p>Summing all correlation coefficents of features wont add up to explained variance as they
                        subtract a covariance factor (ie the relationship between the features).</p>

                    <p>Best guess if not taking variable into account is mean, trying regression is seeing how much
                        better can we do than this mean. Using the mean gives total variance.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Confound:</strong> something else that links IV and DV.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Regularization aims to create models that not only account for maximum variance but are also as
                        simple as possible.</p>
                    <h3>Problems with Multiple Regression</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Multicollinearity:</strong> Predictors are correlated. We want predictors to be
                            uncorrelated to each other, but each correlated to outcome. Solution: use fewer predictors
                            or regularization. [Visually vectors go from plane to roughly a line, so projecting onto 2
                            vectors close to each other means we could draw a plane in many ways and hence
                            wobbly/unreliable project. IE collinearity reduces a dimension but still projecting on full
                            space, so could be any full space. EG if projecting onto a plane, if 2 vectors are collinear
                            (like line), could draw many planes through it. Bad as way too much variance with not much
                            gain].</li>
                        <li><strong>Curse of dimensionality:</strong> Many predictors need lots of parameters, so
                            coverage (some data being in every category possible) becomes an issue. Goes away if lots of
                            data. </li>
                        <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> Model with more variance does not necessarily mean better.
                            With enough parameters can fit any model perfectly. This is problem as every data point is a
                            true value plus noise, so the model won't generalise. Need to cross validate and check RMSE
                            on test set. (Unlike hypothesis testing where you use all data). Doesn't go away with more
                            data.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>One-hot Encoding</h3>
                    <p>Converts categorical variables into separate boolean columns. To avoid the dummy variable trap,
                        one category should be removed to prevent collinearity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dummy Variable Trap:</strong>Using all categories from one hot encoding.</p>

                    <h3>Bias-Variance Tradeoff</h3>
                    <p><strong>Bias:</strong> Model is too simple to capture the relationship (underfitting).</p>
                    <p><strong>Variance:</strong> Model doesn't generalize well (overfitting). Not related to previous
                        variance. High variance means can explain a lot of the relationship.</p>
                    <p>Need middle ground as Linear Regression pushes to high variance, low bias, regression pushes it
                        the other way.</p>

                    <h3>Regularization Techniques</h3>
                    <p><strong>Ridge Regression:</strong> Adds sqrt(Î» * summation of (Î²Â²)) to the minimization term,
                        introducing some bias to
                        fit better to the population.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lasso Regression:</strong> Uses L1 norm as penalty, which can reduce some coefficients to
                        zero.</p>

                    <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
                    <p>Maps continuous inputs to binary outcomes using a nonlinear function (sigmoid). It outputs the
                        odds of two classes and predicts the inverse of the logit (natural log of the odds = sigmoid).
                        Need to choose threshold over which we pick the class.</p>
                    <p>Computes odds of two classes. Probability of happening over probability of not happening. </p>

                    <p>Problems with regression on classification: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Residuals are not normal - needed for LR.</li>
                        <li>RMSE is too high</li>
                        <li>Most predictions are non-sensical</li>
                        <li>Regression is not bounded.

                        </li>
                        <li>Line implies constant increase, but really small range where increase matters a lot for
                            class but after or before does not matter.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>ROC Curve</h3>
                    <p>A metric for classification performance that plots True Positive Rate against False Positive
                        Rate. The Area Under ROC (AUROC) quantifies overall performance, with 0.5 indicating random
                        guessing.</p>
                    <p>Why is accuracy bad for classification? Class imbalance - predicting most common class gets that
                        proportion of accuracy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Called ROC as its from radar usage from WW2. </p>
                    <p>Threshold does not change AUROC value, just changes proportion of true positive vs false
                        positives.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</h3>
                    <p>Finds the line/plane that maximizes the distance between groups. Soft margin SVM allows for some
                        misclassification with a penalty, compared to (hard margin) SVMs.</p>

                    <p>Takes advantage of correlation of columns. We create new columns that only represent the

                        data onto that, then we can keep only the biggest independent values, and these preserve most of
                        the data. In other words, we keep projecting onto directions with most variance. Variables
                        should be standardized
                        (z-score) before PCA.</p>

                        distance to its own cluster versus other clusters. The K with the highest average silhouette
                        score is chosen.</p>

                            bigger fraction as it represents a better classification). Negative means misclassification.
